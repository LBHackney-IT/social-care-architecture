# Architecture Decision Records

An architectural decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important
architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. Further
information can be found on Michael Nygard's
[blog](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

The records in this site:

- Should be read in conjunction, and linked, with the [central Hackney IT ADR repository](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/lbh-adrs).
- The records defined here should document Social Care Tools __specific variations__ from the [Hackney IT ADR decisions](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/lbh-adrs).
- Please ensure the Hackney Repository contains links to this repository.

## Tools

ADRs are generated and maintained using Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools). As each ADR is plain text, they may be added without the tools - however the tools do help maintain consistency.

## Records
